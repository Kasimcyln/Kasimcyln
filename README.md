**Software Team Management and Task Distribution:**
Task distribution was carried out for the software team, and the progress of tasks was regularly monitored, with feedback provided on completed work. Revision requests were made, and process optimization was ensured. Task tracking and process management were performed using Jira. Additionally, regular meetings were organized with the software team to assess the project status and make strategic decisions.

**DOORS Application:**
The second version of the Doors application, used to open doors and barriers via a mobile app or QR code, was developed. While MVP and EventBus were used in the first version, MVVM and Clean Architecture were implemented in the second version. HTTPS and MQTT protocols were used for communication. The doors were connected to a relay board, providing a more efficient solution with less hardware.
